[OAUTH]
# this section is for the Snowflake OAuth settings.
# this will be for the Snowflake OAuth setting and
# the section below will be for External OAuth

# these are the most sensitive values there are here.
# in a prodction setting, strongly consider managing
# them with a seecrets management platform. Read about

# the interation in Snowflake, and the URL that will be
# used to reach the app while it's running.

[EXTOAUTH]

# could be something like a URL or a string depending on
